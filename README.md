# COP4500 Numerical Calculus Assignment 1

This application was built with `Python` using the `NumPy` library.

## Purpose 

This repository is here to demonstrate an understanding of calculating double-precision floating point numbers,
k-digit rounding and chopping arithmetic, absolute and relative error, methods for infinite series, and finding roots 
in a polynomial using the bisection and Newton-Raphson methods.
